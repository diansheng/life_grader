# Incentive #

Most of people play computer games nowadays. And it is undeniable that computer games are attractive. People enjoy it while playing and time just snips away. Some people life is hard. So the idea comes nature to me, how about making life as enjoyable as a game?

After some research, I believe the key factor for be attractive is to reward fast. People are way much faster rewarded in game than in real life. That's why games are more attractive. How people are rewarded? Most of the time, it does not have to be something in reality. People play game for higher score in a match, or a rare achievement, or higher rank in the game. 

Resemble the game rewarding system, I plan to build a rewarding system for people's daily activities. You get more rewarded by involving in more important and meaningful activities, like working, studying and exercising.
